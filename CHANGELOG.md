## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-10

### added

- `fox git` — branch (datestamp + random adjective-animal name), prune, show, size, notes
- `fox docker` — show, ps, rm, imgprune, notes
- `fox tar` — notes reference for tar, zip, xz
- `fox rsync` — notes reference for rsync and scp
- `fox tmux` — notes reference for sessions, windows, panes
- `fox date` — now, stamp, time, notes
- `fox system restart` — restart current shell via `exec $SHELL -l`
- `fox_require` helper — exits with clear error when a dependency is not on PATH
- `fox_notes_header` helper — dim styled section headers for notes output
- local notes now accept `.md` and `.txt` (dropped `.sh` for safety)
- help menu grouped into `tools` and `fox` sections
- `notes` subcommand visually separated with blank line in per-tool help
- git added to sandbox Dockerfile for git subcommand tests (45 tests total)

### changed

- notes layout: section headers (`reference`, `notes`, `local notes`) now styled with dim color
- notes sections use heredocs with a helper rather than printf chains
- local notes file lookup order: `.md` → `.txt` (cat only; no shell execution)
